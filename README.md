# GPM-rainfall-data-analysis-for-landslides
Analysis of GPM rainfall data with the purpose of characterizing rainfalls that triggered landslides and draw ID curves
2 main scripts:
 * analysisrainfallGPM.m ====> can run for a single event or batch
 * findrainfalls.m ===> allows to find high intensity rainfalls in a year timeseries
Other files are functions that are used by the 2 main scripts. 

Generate maximally perceptually-distinct colors toolbox will be needed. Download from here and save in the same folder as the scripts and functions:
